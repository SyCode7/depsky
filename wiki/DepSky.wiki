=*Introduction*=

DepSky is a system that improves the availability, confidentiality and integrity of stored data in the cloud. It reaches this goal by encrypting, enconding and replicating all the data on a set of differents clouds, forming a cloud-of-clouds.

More specifically DepSky address four important limitations:

 * *Loss of availability* - DepSky addresses this limitation because it replicates all the data in a set of clouds, and even if some of them presents some problems, all the data will be available if a subset of them are reachable. 

 * *Loss an corruption of data* - DepSky deals with this problem using Byzantine fault-tolerance replication to store data in a cloud-of-clouds, being possible get the data correctly even if some of the clouds corrupt or lose data.  

 * *Loss of privacy* - DepSky employs a secret sharing scheme and erasure codes to ensure that all data that will be stored in a cloud-of-clouds is in ciphertext.

 * *Vendor lock-in* - DepSky addresses this limitation because unlike use a single cloud provider, use a set of them.

=*Costs*=

As would be expected, a DepSky client would be required to pay four (using a cloud-of-clouds of four cloud providers) times more than he would pay if uses a single cloud. That not happens (if using DepSky-CA protocol)due to the erasure codes techniques. The erasure codes technique used () allow us to store in each of the four cloud providers only half of the orginal block data size. So, using DepSky, the client only will pay twice more than using a single cloud.
