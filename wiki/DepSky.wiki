DepSky is a system that improves the availability, confidentiality and integrity of stored data in the cloud. It reaches this goal by encrypting, enconding and replicating all the data on a set of differents clouds, forming a cloud-of-clouds.

More specifically DepSky address four important limitations:

 * *Loss of availability* - DepSky addresses this limitation because it replicates all the data in a set of clouds, and even if some of them presents some problems, all the data will be available if a subset of them are reachable. 

 * *Loss an corruption of data* - DepSky deals with this problem using Byzantine fault-tolerance replication to store data in a cloud-of-clouds, being possible get the data correctly even if some of the clouds corrupt or lose data.  

 * *Loss of privacy* - DepSky employs a secret sharing scheme and erasure codes to ensure that all data that will be stored in a cloud-of-clouds is in ciphertext

 * *Vendor lock-in* - DepSky addresses this limitation because unlike use a single cloud provider, use a set of them.
