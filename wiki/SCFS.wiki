=*Introduction*=

SCFS is a cloud-backed file system that provides strong consistency even on top of eventually-consistent cloud storage services. SCFS provides also a pluggable backend that allows it to work with a single cloud or with a cloud-of-clouds.

=*Architecture*=  

The figure bellow presents the architecture of SCFS with its three main components: the backend cloud storage for maintaining the file data (shown as a cloud-of-clouds, but that can also be just a cloud); the coordination service for managing the metadata and to support synchronization; and the SCFS Agent that implements most of the SCFS functionality, and corresponds to the file system client mounted at the user machine.
