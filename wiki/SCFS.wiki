=*Introduction*=

SCFS is a cloud-backed file system that provides strong consistency even on top of eventually-consistent cloud storage services. SCFS provides also a pluggable backend that allows it to work with a single cloud or with a cloud-of-clouds.

It main concern is address some of the problems presented on the other existing cloud-backed file systems:

 # Most of them not support controlled file sharing among clients.
 # Some, use a proxy to connect with the cloud storage, which can be a single point of failure, once if it is down, no client can access to the data stored at the cloud side.
 # Almost all file systems use only one single cloud as backend.

The figure bellow presents the architecture of SCFS with its three main components: the backend cloud storage for maintaining the file data (shown as a cloud-of-clouds, but that can also be just a cloud); the coordination service for managing the metadata and to support synchronization; and the SCFS Agent that implements most of the SCFS functionality, and corresponds to the file system client mounted at the user machine.

SCFS is a very configurable file system, once the client can use it according with their needs.
