=*Introduction*=

SCFS is a cloud-backed file system that provides strong consistency even on top of eventually-consistent cloud storage services. SCFS provides also a pluggable backend that allows it to work with a single cloud or with a cloud-of-clouds.

It main concern is address some of the problems presented on the exiting cloud-backed file systems like S3FS, S3QL and BlueSky:

#  S3FS and S3QL does not support controlled file sharing among clients.
#  BlueSky' proxy is a single point of failure, once if it is down, no client can access to the data stored at the cloud side.
#  The three file systems use only one single cloud as backend.

The figure bellow presents the architecture of SCFS with its three main components: the backend cloud storage for maintaining the file data (shown as a cloud-of-clouds, but that can also be just a cloud); the coordination service for managing the metadata and to support synchronization; and the SCFS Agent that implements most of the SCFS functionality, and corresponds to the file system client mounted at the user machine.

This is the component that implements the file systems calls.
