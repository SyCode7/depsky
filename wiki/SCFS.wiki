=*Introduction*=

SCFS is a cloud-backed file system that provides strong consistency even on top of eventually-consistent cloud storage services. SCFS provides also a pluggable backend that allows it to work with a single cloud or with a cloud-of-clouds.

It main concern is address some of the problems presented on the other existing cloud-backed file systems:

 # Most of them not support controlled file sharing among clients.
 # Some, use a proxy to connect with the cloud storage, which is a single point of failure, once if it is down, no client can access to the data stored at the cloud side.
 # Almost all file systems use only one single cloud as backend.


=*Architecture*=  

The figure bellow presents the architecture of SCFS with its three main components: the backend cloud storage for maintaining the file data; the coordination service for managing the metadata and to support synchronization; and the SCFS Agent that implements most of the SCFS functionality, and corresponds to the file system client mounted at the user machine.

The figure shows the backend cloud storage as cloud-of-clouds formed by Amazon S3, Google Storage, RackSpace Cloud Files and Windows Azure. To store data in this clouds, SCFS uses DepSky. More specifically, uses !DepSky-CA protocol once we want address the main cloud storage limitations (see DepSky). SCFS allow also a different backend formed by only one cloud. 
 



=*Operation Modes*=

SCFS is a very configurable file system, once the client can use it according with their needs.
